# DERO_CLI-TOOLS_SCRIPT

## For 1-liner to setup scroll down! 

## This is a script, I've only situated the tools for easy access. All credit for the tools being used inside of this script goes to their respective creators! 

#### - So far this includes only HANSEN33 for the miner used & also his teammate MARCEL who helps with the pool they run. 
The miner that's used is found here: [Hansen33's Miner](https://github.com/Hansen333/Hansen33-s-DERO-Miner)

Default usage sets node for mining to: [HANSEN33'S SOLO NODE](https://dero-node.mysrv.cloud) or [HANSEN33'S MINING POOL](https://community-pools.mysrv.cloud). You can also find their X (formerly twitter) account [DERO COMMUNITY POOLS](https://twitter.com/DeroCmtyPools)

Ensure to thank these fellas for making this possible.

*Android, Mac, and Windows versions coming soon*

**Meanwhile, install WSL on your windows machine to use for now.**

#### The next version includes ability to create wallet as well, if you do not have one already. For now you must have one ready to paste in.
